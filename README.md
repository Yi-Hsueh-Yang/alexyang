## Where am I right now

Iâ€™m a Lead Data Scientist based in Chicago, IL. I have been with [Kero Gaming](https://kerosports.com/) for since June, 2024. Kero is an innovative startup reimagining sports engagement through gamification. I develop and optimize odds-setting and pricing models using advanced machine learning and statistical approaches. As the data science lead for the MLB vertical, I oversee projects from concept to deploymentâ€”transforming massive datasets into predictive insights that shape product performance and fan experience.

## A Little About Me
- CMU Grad (Heinz College), Major in Data Analytics <br>
- Interned at 2 emerging start-ups [EzOut](https://ezout.store/) and [Culturora](https://www.culturora.com/), as a Data Science Intern(1 year) and Data Analyst Intern(3 months), focusing on putting ML models into production to take care of customer satisfaction/retention.<be>
- Once collaborated with [Nexteer Automotive](https://www.nexteer.com/) as a Student Data Scientist on a project about creating a predictive model and interactive dashboard for greenhouse gas emission prediction.
- I have my passion lies in the field of data engineering and applied science.<br>
- This is my first year holding a H1-B visa in the US with Kero.
