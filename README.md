## Selected Projects Showcase

1. [RouteGenius](https://github.com/Yi-Hsueh-Yang/RouteGenius.git)
   * RouteGenius is a cutting-edge solution that revolutionizes delivery network optimization through the implementation of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using Optimization through Gurobi and OptiGuide.
2. [Network Narrators](https://github.com/cmu-seai/group-project-s24-network-narrators.git)
   * An end-to-end movie Recommendation System, including multiple production-needed services, e.g. monitoring, auto-experimenting, testing, logging, continuous integration, auto-training, etc.
3. [GameStop Short Squeeze Analysis](https://github.com/Yi-Hsueh-Yang/Flight-Price-Analysis.git)
   * Utilizing the yfinance package and Harvard Dataverse's sentiment data, this project digs into the [GameStop Short Squeeze Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze) that happened in 2021 by analyzing sentiment scores and employing time series models for insights on the influence of social media sentiment on stock prices and the importance of data shaping in LSTM performance.
4. [Finding Patterns in the Stream: A Machine Learning Analysis of Netflix Movie Data](https://github.com/Yi-Hsueh-Yang/NetlixMovieAnalysis.git)
   * As consultants for Netflix, this project leverages data science techniques such as clustering, association rule mining, and topic modeling to analyze customer interactions and patterns on the platform, using datasets from the Netflix Prize, IMDb, GitHub, and Wikipedia to enhance customer retention and satisfaction by predicting IMDb ratings, examining plot descriptions, and identifying frequently watched movie sets.
5. [AI-Policy-LLM](https://github.com/Yi-HsuehYang/94812_Personal_assignment1.git)
   * This project's core ambition is to develop a chat environment, fine-tuned with advanced prompting techniques, capable of understanding and generating nuanced discussions on AI policy matters.
6. [Flight Price Analysis](https://telecom-churn-prediction.streamlit.app/)
   * This project analyzes US domestic flight prices, with the goal of understanding the dynamics behind airline pricing to help travelers make informed decisions. By investigating factors like day of the week, seat availability, and destination differences within the same city, the project utilizes data visualization to reveal trends and patterns that could influence future purchasing strategies for consumers.
7. [Telecom Churn Analysis](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19v5unicInrMjSnXscE7TRm1tFZFllfCk?usp=sharing)
   * This project developed predictive models to identify drivers of customer churn for a CA-based telecom company, enhancing data pipelines and utilizing advanced segmentation to improve retention strategies effectively.
